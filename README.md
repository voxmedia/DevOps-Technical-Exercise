# Welcome to the DevOps technical exercise!

**You should spend a maximum of 2 hours on this exercise.**   
The goal of this exercise is to help us inform a technical discussion and gage your level of comfort with writing and discussing code. Understanding your thought process is more important than whether or not you finished, so we do not expect  a "perfect" solution. That said, when we meet we expect you to be prepared to discuss:

- Your process (how you got started, where you ran into difficulties, any research/googling you did, etc)
- The reasons behind your decisions
- How you would do things differently


## Prompt

A new startup, *Healthly*, specializes in a product that monitors a repositoryâ€™s health and sends specific metrics to a [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel on a schedule.

It sends the following messages:
* A list of new CVEs given an application's framework
* A warning indicating that n number of branches are older than 2 weeks
* A notice of failing tests.

## Instructions

Using the language and framework of your choice, please implement two features of the *Healthly* product, i.e. build a tool that will send two of these metrics on a schedule.

## Getting Started && Deliverables
- Proceed with the exercise using the language or framework that you are comfortable with and feel will allow you to produce highest quality of work given the time frame.
- Once you consider yourself done and/or the 2 hours window is complete, add a README with instructions on how to run the application locally.
- ZIP up your code and send it to the recruiter in an email.


## Evaluation Criteria
- Is the codebase clear and understandable?
- Is the user experience intuitive?
- Does the codebase follow best practices? (useful comments, naming conventions, etc.)

That's it! Have fun!
